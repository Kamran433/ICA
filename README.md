# Independent Component Analysis (ICA) Project

This project provides a web-based application for separating mixed signals into their independent components using Independent Component Analysis. It's designed for educational and research purposes in signal processing.

## Description

The ICA Project offers a simple interface for users to upload mixed audio and image files. The application then applies ICA algorithms to separate these mixed signals into their independent components, displaying the results in an intuitive format.

## Features

- Web interface for uploading audio and image files.
- Signal processing using Independent Component Analysis.
- Separate audio signals into distinct tracks.
- Decompose mixed images into individual components.
- Visual and auditory presentation of results.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the ICA Project in your local environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ICA-Project.git
cd ICA-Project

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Flask application
python app.py
```

## Usage

After installation, navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser. Follow these steps:

1. Choose between audio or image processing.
2. Upload the mixed file.
3. Select the ICA method (if multiple options are available).
4. Submit the file for processing.
5. View and listen to the separated components.
6. Download the results if needed.
